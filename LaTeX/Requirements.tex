\section{Introduction}
The Buzz system is to be developed to enhance user interaction by means of a online discussion board, this board will have multiple components to allow for better user interactions by means of rewards, ranks and privileges. This document serves as the Architectural specifications for the Buzz system. Including the constraints imposed by the client Ms. Vrede Pieterse.

\section{Architectural Requirements}
\subsection{Access channel and integration requirements} 
\subsubsection{Access channels}
\paragraph{Human access channels}
\paragraph{System access channels}
\subsubsection{Integration Channels}
\paragraph{Integration Channel}
\begin{itemize}
\item \hfill The Enterprise service bus will be used. The bus is a subsystem that facilitates the communication between other subsystems. This means that subsystems only need to communicate through the ESB. This significantly lowers the amount of necessary connections and it processes the messages, meaning other subsystems need not waste time processing messages. If a subsystem is replaced or added, the only changes that need to take place is the creation of a new interface between the new system and the bus. This makes the system much more flexible  and makes communication much more simple.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Protocols Used}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hypertext Transfer Protocol

HTTP is the standard way and method to transfer method of web pages over the internet by using the protocols TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) to manage the Web transmission. In use of Buzz all posting, registering and even just access to the forums will make use of these protocols.

\item Mail Protocols POP3 and SMTP

Post Office Protocol (POP) will probably not be used within the system but is used in receiving emails. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) will be used though, the protocol is used in the sending of emails by making use of a SMTP server. In the case of Buzz all notifications that are not present within Buzz will be sent through email such as account verification and notification of changes within a userâ€™s account. Finally if a user loses account details all information and lost password would be sent over email.

\item File Transfer Protocol

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the method of copying files over the internet or a network but more simply put allows for the transfer of information from one computer to a remote computer. In terms of Buzz we are not creating a File Server but rather with all the images profile pictures and any other documentation that are uploaded to different profiles for other users to use make use of the File Transfer Protocol.

\subsection{Architectural responsibilities}  % Matthew
\begin{itemize}
	\item The System must be able to provide concurrent clients to read threads, post threads and update threads.
	\item The system should be able to store all threads and posts, as well as who posted, and whether a thread has been deleted.
	\item The system should provide an integration environment to allow for multiple deployment
	\item The system could allow for persistent data storage for easy 'Remember Me'
	\item Storage of archived thread
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture constraints} % Semaka & Werner

\begin{description}
		\item[Reference Architecture] \hfill \\
		 	 \begin{itemize}	
				\item Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is specified as the chosen Reference Architecture to use.
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE is Oracle's enterprise Java computing platform. The platform provides an
							 API and runtime environment for developing and running enterprise software, including network and web services, and
							 other large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications. Java EE extends the Java Platform, 
							Standard Edition (Java SE),  providing an API for object-relational mapping, distributed and multi-tier architectures, and
							 web services. 
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\		
					\end{description}
			\end{itemize}
		\item[Other Software Technologies] \hfill \\
			\begin{itemize}
				\item JPA (Java Persistence API)
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java programming language application programming interface specification that
							 describes the management of relational data in applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\
							
					\end{description}
				\item JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							The Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) is a platform-independent object-oriented query language defined as part
							 of the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification. JPQL is used to make queries against entities stored in a relational database.
							 It is heavily inspired by SQL, and its queries resemble SQL queries in syntax, but operate against JPA entity objects rather
							 than directly with database tables.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\
							
					\end{description}
				\item JSF (JavaServer Faces)
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications and
							 exposing them as server side Polyfills.] It was formalized as a standard through the Java Community Process and is
							 part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\	
					\end{description}
				\item HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\
							
					\end{description}
				\item AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							Ajax is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications.
							 With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering
							 with the display and behavior of the existing page.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\		
					\end{description}
				\item CSS
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							Cascading Style Sheet will be used for the formatting and styling of the discussion forum. It will ensure separation of the content from presentation.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\
					\end{description}	
				\item Github
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							Github will be the platform used by the developers to collaborate. This will be where all the code will be pushed so that the developers can be able to work together from remote locations and be able to combine all their code/work.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\
					\end{description}
			\end{itemize}	
		\item[Operating System] \hfill 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Linux
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							The forum will  be designed to work on any Operating system. However, Linux is ideal for certain functionalities therefore the forum will work optimally on Linux Operating Systems. The web server will be hosted on a Linux machine as Linux is widely considered to be the best operating system  for web servers. 
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\
							
					\end{description}
			\end{itemize}	
		\item[Deployed Environments] \hfill 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Web Based Interface
					\begin{description}
						\item[Details] \hfill \\
							Users will be able to navigate to the application using a web browser from any compatible device, such as a tablet; smartphone or computer.
						\item[Comments]\hfill \\
							This is a very suitable environment since it allows for a large measure of ease of access.
					\end{description}
				\item Android (out of scope - for future reference)
